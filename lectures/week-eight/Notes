## INTERNET - WEB DEV ##


What is the internet?
    The infrastructure connecting devices via specified protocols.
    A mesh network consisting of a vast amount of routers that relay data as needed.


Protocols: A set of conventions to adhere to.
    eg; TCP/IP

    Packets - Small pieces of information.
        -Akin to envelopes.
        -Packet routing is not garunteed to be the same
        -Contain sequence number too ensure order

    IP: Internet
        Protocol
        -Contains an address.
            -Akin to an address on envelope

    TCP: Transmission
         Control
         Protocol

         Convenient for servers to do multiple things
         Contains a PORT number
         Handles delivery.
            Ensures when you send data, if anything gets lost, retransmits as needed.

        Adaptive solution to packet routing inconsistencies.

    PORT:
        Integer that represents a specific request type.

        80 : HTTP - Insecure web traffic
        443 : HTTPS - Secure web traffic

    DNS: Domain
         Name
         System

         -Defines IP address' as a readable string of characters for humans to read.
          Converts human readable format to an IP address.

    HTTP(s):
        Specific to web servers

        Commands:
            GET - Keyword to request data from a server
            POST

        https://www.example.com/
            https - (s) means secure/encrypted
            www. - Convention to represent an address of a web server as opposed to file server or the likes
            example.com - Domain name
            .com - Referred to as Top Level Domain (TLD) Generally categorized type of website ie; example.gov - government, example.us - american ...
            /index.html -> implicit, hidden file as the root. example.com = example.com/index.html

        Reqeuest Header Example:
            GET / HTTP/1.1 - <request type> / <protocol> / <version>
            Host: www.example.com - Provides context information to ensure correct url
            Connection: Keep-Alive
            ...
        Response Header Example:
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK <protocol>/<version> <status-code> <short desc>
            Content-Type: text/html
            Location: https://www.example.com - This header allows a redirect
            ...
            HTTP/1.1 403 FORBIDDEN


        Wildcards:
            GET /search?q=cats HTTP/1.1
            Host: www.google.com/
            ...
            ?q=cats - sets the q variable to cats for HTTP to process

        Status Codes:
            200 - OK
            301 - Moved Permanently
            304 - Not Modified - Use cache
            307 - Temporary Redirect
            401 - Unauthorized
            403 - Forbidden
            404 - Not Found
            418 - I'm a teapot ?
            500 - Internal Server Error

        Mime Types:
            text/html
            image/jpg

    Routing:
        USER <request> -> Router(s) -> DNS Host -> Web-Server <packetize, return>
        Metaphorically tells router to send on one of two cables to and from end points
        Utilize - Routing Tables



## HTML ##

Hyper Text Markup Language

    tags - enclosed in < >
    attributes - define characteristics for tags

    Example:
        <!DOCTYPE html> - Formal declaration of document type

        <html lang="en"> - open tag - lang= is an attribute
            <head> - top of web page
                <title>
                    hello, title
                </title>
            </head>
            <body> - viewport
                hello, body
            </body>
        </html> - close tag

    -Contains a heiracheral structure where there may be many children
    -Representation of a data-structure

                document
                  |
                html
            head    body
              |       |
            title   'hello, body'
              |
    'hello, title'

    -Server is required to 'serve' the html page/file


## JAVASCROPT ##

Javascript interacts directly with the Document of the webpage (DOM)

Implemented in HTML using <script src="path/to/file.js"></script>

Using document.querySelector('body') you can modify the body's css directly with .style attribute

Developer Tools!
    CTRL + Right Mouse -> inspect

Syntax Examples:
    let x = 0;
    x++;

    if (x < y)
    {
    }
    else if ()
    {
    }
    else
    {
    }

    while (true)
    {
    }

    for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++)
    {
    }

Listen Events:

    click
    drag
    focus
