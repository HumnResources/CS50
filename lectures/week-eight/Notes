## INTERNET - WEB DEV ##


What is the internet?
    The infrastructure connecting devices via specified protocols.
    A mesh network consisting of a vast amount of routers that relay data as needed.
    Interconnected network consisting of smaller networks


Protocols: A set of conventions to adhere to.
    eg; TCP/IP

    Packets - Small pieces of information.
        IP LAYER   |
        TCP LAYER  | -> Wrapped -> Unwrapped by TCP
        <data>     |

        Receiver IP
        25<port> / 1 of 4 <seq>
        <data>

        -Akin  to envelopes.
        -Packet routing is not garunteed to be the same


    IP: Internet
        Protocol
        -Contains an address.
            -Akin to an address on envelope
            -32-bit unique address
            -Represented as four, 8-bit clusters
            w.x.y.z - non negative values from 0-255 - IPv4

            IPv6 is 128-bit addresses
            s:t:u:v:w:x:y:z - represents 1-4 hex digits in the range [0, FFFF]
                1234:5678:90ab:fe33:123f:ffe3:5554:cab3
                2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8844 - google
                    2001:4860:4860::8844

        Connectionless Protocol
            Packets can be directed multiple ways to reach the end point

    TCP: Transmission
         Control
         Protocol

        Directs the packets to the correct service or program.

        Garuntees delivery

        Convenient for servers to do multiple things
        Contains a PORT number
        Handles delivery.
            Ensures when you send data, if anything gets lost, retransmits as needed.

        Adaptive solution to packet routing inconsistencies.

    PORT:
        Integer that represents a specific request type.
        21 - FTP - File Trasnfer Protocol
        25 - SMTP (e-mail)
        53 - DNS - Domain Name System
        80 : HTTP - Insecure web traffic
        443 : HTTPS - Secure web traffic

    DHCP:
        Assigns an IP address to a connected device. Hosted on a server.

    DNS: Domain
         Name
         System

         -Defines IP address' as a readable string of characters for humans to read.
          Converts human readable format to an IP address.

         Dictionary, it's just a k,v pair of; www.example.com -> 0.0.0.0
            Usually local DNS repositories that get aggregated together
            Decentralized

    HTTP(s):
        Application Layer Protocol
            Other Examples; FTP/SMTP/DDS/RDP/XMPP

        Specifies how to make a web server

        Methods:
            GET - Keyword to request data from a server
            POST

        https://www.example.com/
            https - (s) means secure/encrypted
            www. - Convention to represent an address of a web server as opposed to file server or the likes
            example.com - Domain name
            .com - Referred to as Top Level Domain (TLD) Generally categorized type of website ie; example.gov - government, example.us - american ...
            /index.html -> implicit, hidden file as the root. example.com = example.com/index.html

        Reqeuest Header Example:
            GET / HTTP/1.1 - <request type> <dir> <protocol> / <version> || <method> <request-target> <http-version>
            Host: www.example.com - Provides context information to ensure correct url
            Connection: Keep-Alive
            ...
        Response Header Example:
            HTTP/1.1 200 OK <protocol>/<version> <status-code> <opt:short desc>
            Content-Type: text/html
            Location: https://www.example.com - This header allows a redirect
            ...
            HTTP/1.1 403 FORBIDDEN


        Variables:
            GET /search?q=cats HTTP/1.1
            Host: www.google.com/
            ...
            ?q=cats - sets the q variable to cats for HTTP to process

        Status Code Classes:
            Success
                200 - OK

            Redirection
                301 - Moved Permanently
                302 - Found Temporarily
                304 - Not Modified - Use cache
                307 - Internal Redirect

            Client Error
                401 - Unauthorized
                403 - Forbidden
                404 - Not Found
                418 - I'm a teapot ? - David Malan's Lecture

            Server Error
                500 - Internal Server Error
                504 - Gateway Timeout

        Mime Types:
            text/html
            image/jpg

    Routing:
        USER <request> -> Router(s) -> DNS Host -> Web-Server <packetize, return>
        Metaphorically tells router to send on one of two cables to and from end points

## HTML ##
    Hyper Text Markup Language

    tags - enclosed in < >
    attributes - define characteristics for tags

    Example:
        <!DOCTYPE html> - Formal declaration of document type default HTML5

        <!-- Comments suck in html -->

        <html lang="en"> - open tag - lang= is an attribute
            <head> - top of web page
                <title>
                    hello, title
                </title>
            </head>
            <body> - viewport
                hello, body
            </body>
        </html> - close tag

    -Contains a heiracheral structure where there may be many children
    -Representation of a data-structure

               document
                  |
                html
            head    body
              |       |
            title   'hello, body'
              |
    'hello, title'

    -Server is required to 'serve' the html page/file

    Tags:
        Tags contain their own properties to change behavior

        <b> </b> - Boldface
        <i> </i> - Italicize
        <u> </u> - underline
        <p> </p> - Paragraphs
        <h> </h> - Headers 1-6

        <ul> </ul> - unordered list
        <ol> </ol> - ordered list
        <li> </li> - list item

        <table> </table>
        <tr> </tr> - table row
        <ti> </ti> - table item

        <form> </form>
        <input name=<id> type=<data> /> - Field within form. Data Types; test/password/radio/checkbox/submit
            Self-closing

        <div> </div> - Marks arbitrary division of the page


        <a href=<url> </a> - anchor tag
        <img src=<url> /> - Image
            Self-closing

## JAVASCRIPT ##
    Javascript interacts directly with the Document of the webpage (DOM)
    Client-side browser language based off the C family of languages.

    Dynamically typed.

    Implemented in HTML using
        <script src="path/to/file.js"></script>

    Using;
        document.querySelector('body')
    you can modify the body's css directly with .style attribute

    Developer Tools!
        CTRL + Right Mouse -> inspect

    Syntax Examples:
        let x = 0;
        x++;
        ?:

        if (x < y)
        {};
        else if ()
        {};
        else
        {};

        while (true)
        {};

        for (let x = 0; x < 5; x++)
        {};

        function <name>(<params>)
        {};

        // Anonymous function - Maps() are a good use
        function ()
        {};
        let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
        nums = nums.map(function(num) {
            return num * 2;
        });


        // Anonymous function defined as const lambda
        const () => {};

        // Objects - Contain methods that apply to that object only
        let obj = {name : 'okay', num : 123, ...};

        // Array
        let arr = [val1, val2, ...];

        // Loops(redux)
        for (let key in obj) // iterates keys
        {
            // use object[key] ...
        };
        for (let key of obj) // iterates values
        {
            // use key ...
        };


    Listen Events:
        blur
        change - drop down menus/toggles etc
        click
        drag
        focus
        ketup
        load
        mousedown
        mouseover
        mouseup
        submit
        touchmove
        unload
        keyup
        keydown
        ...


## CSS ##
    Cascading Style Sheets
    Key, Value pairs that define behavior/style of an item defined using selectors

    Properties:
        border: <style> <color> <width>;
        background-color: <color|hex>;
        foreground-color: ...;
        font-size: <absolute|relative>;
            keywords(small|smaller<relative>), fixed points(10pt), percent
        text-align: <left|right|center|justify>



    Selectors:
        # - ID - Only applies to element conaining unique ID
        . - Class - Can encapsulate many elements placing at root of elements
        element - Specific element only

    Use;
        <style> </style>
        <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"> * Preferred method
            -rel means relative to file for context on how to treat it
    To include ine html file.
