## CYBER-SECURITY ##


-Impossible to create a 'perfectly' secure system.

Password Examples
    Total n of possibilities: product of k^length where k is the total number of possiblities for each character of the password.

    Numbers:
        10^4 = 10 000

    Numbers/letters(distinct):
        52^4 = 7 311 616

    Characters(distinct):
        94^4 = 78 074 896

    Characters(distinct) + length of 8:
        94^8 = 6 095 689 385 410 816 - 6 Quadrillion

    Characters(distinct) + length of 10:
        94^10 = Quintillions


## DEFINITIONS ##

Secure: When a system is, probabistically, safe from 'attackers'.

Brute-force Attack: Continuously attempt password/key one at a time. Uses dictionaries of words, can take some time.

Encryption: 'Scrambling' data with a key, so it is unrecognizable to third-parties.
    Eg; https:// - 's' means secure connection to web server.

End-to-End Encryption: When all points of data aggeregation between you and the recipient are encrypted.
